# airwindows
Fork of Chris Johnson's Air Windows repo (https://github.com/airwindows/airwindows) for juce ports of each effect

I've included simple IO Juce Audio App examples for each effect, as well as the AudioSource classes in a seperate folder, building the examples should be as simple as opening the .jucer file in each folder with Projucer.

Only tested on Windows 10, with the latest version of Juce, but should work out of the box on mac, just not sure if ASIO is a thing on mac, so if it errors, look there first!
